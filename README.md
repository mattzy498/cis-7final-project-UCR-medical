1. The program prompts the user to select their desired medical specialization from a list of options.
2. Next, the user selects their preferred language of communication from the available choices.
3. The user is then asked to choose their preferred country for medical residency.
4. The program generates a lottery number and compares it to predefined probabilities to determine the outcome.
5. The user is informed whether they have secured their preferred country and specialization or not.
6. The program displays the user's lottery number and the probabilities associated with securing their preferred country and specialization.
7. Additional information is provided based on the user's language selection and specialization choice.
8. The program concludes with a thank you message.
